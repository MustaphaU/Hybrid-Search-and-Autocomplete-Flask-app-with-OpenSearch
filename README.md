# Lexical (BM25) and Neural (Sparse Embeddings) Hybrid Search with Autocomplete Using OpenSearch

## Description
This project demonstrates a hybrid search application that combines traditional full-text (lexical/BM25) search with semantic (neural) search using sparse embeddings powered by OpenSearch. It also provides autocomplete functionality to improve user search experience.
